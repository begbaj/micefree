# Micefree
Never use again a mouse for fast matters.

## purpose
Micefree is a Xorg utility that lets you never touch your mouse again if not strictly neccessary.
this means, for just one click matters, you don't need to leave the keyboard.

## Mappings
Activate with a shortcut (default to right ctrl), then you will se a grid on the screen:

select the collumn with Q W E R T Y U I O P

select the row with A S D F G H J K L

by default, Micefree will click on the center of the selected rectangle

If micefree is invoked with Shift+(Right)Ctrl, after first selection, a popup window will
appear on the center of the screen. Again, select collumn and row, click will happen on the center of the newly selected rectangle.
